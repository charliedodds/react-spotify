# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run the app by cloning and moving into the repo, running `npm i` to download required dependencies and then `npm start`

## Improvements:

- Make design responsive
- Increase test coverage
- Make components more modular, i.e move action buttons to their own container component for example
